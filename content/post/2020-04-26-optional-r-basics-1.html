<h1>Welcome</h1>
<p>Welcome to to the course! This is the first of 2 sets of exercises introducing you to R, if you are not that familiar with it, or you would like to practice R basics before getting started.</p>
</div>
<div id="section-getting-started-with-r-and-rstudio" class="section level1">
<h1>Getting Started with R and RStudio</h1>
<p>To complete the exercises in this course, you will need to access RStudio.</p>
<p>You can do this in the cloud on the course’s <strong>RStudio cloud</strong> site:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://rstudio.cloud/project/1140732" class="uri">https://rstudio.cloud/project/1140732</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Or download and <strong>install</strong> R and RStudio on your computer:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>Install R: <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/" class="uri">https://cran.r-project.org/</a></p></li>
<li><p>Install RStudio (free version): <a href="https://rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/" class="uri">https://rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/</a></p></li>
</ol>
</div>
<div id="section-install-packages" class="section level1">
<h1>Install packages</h1>
<p>In base R, use the <code>install.packages()</code> function to install the add-on packages you’ll need to gather and manage data:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>install.packages(&quot;tidyverse&quot;)</code></pre>
<p>To use the packages, you need to theme with the <code>library()</code> function:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>library(&quot;tidyverse&quot;)</code></pre>
<p>Personally, I prefer (and will use for the rest of the course) <code>xfun::pkg_attach2()</code>. It installs packages if they aren’t present and loads them all in one call.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>xfun::pkg_attach2(&quot;tidyverse&quot;)</code></pre>
<p>Note you will need to install the <code>xfun</code> package (<code>install.packages("xfun")</code>) if you haven’t already.</p>
