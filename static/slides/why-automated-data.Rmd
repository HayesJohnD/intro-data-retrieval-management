# 🤔 In your research:

- do you plan to **repeat** the task?

- do you want others to be able to **replicate** your data collection process?

- do you use **online** data sources?

- does the data task have **non-trivial** scope and complexity?

# Automated data retrieval

> process of **programmatically** extracting data (from structured and unstructured sources) for further data processing, analysis, and storage.

# Programmatic

> a task done through computer program **code**, not manual.

# Ideally our programs are **extensible**

> designed to be used not just with data we have seen, but also new data.

# 🎓 Academic

- Skills needed to do **original quantitative research** for your **research**.

- State-of-the-art tools needed for **future high-level academic research**.

    + Take advantage of new data sources

    + Avoid effort duplication

    + Make your research reproducible

---

# 🏛 Government 

- Public data is increasingly **accessible**.

    + e.g. [World Bank Development Indicators](http://data.worldbank.org/data-catalog/world-development-indicators),
    [GovData Germany](https://www.govdata.de/neues), [Berlin Open Data](https://daten.berlin.de/), [data.gov.uk](http://data.gov.uk/),
    [New York City](https://nycopendata.socrata.com/),
    [data.gov](https://www.data.gov/open-gov/)

- Governments rely on data analysis for evidence based decision-making.

    + Tools of open data analysis enable better use of data **within** and
    **between** government actors.

    + Governments can take advantage of analyses done by **third parties**.

---

# 🏕 NGOs

NGO's are becoming increasingly data-oriented and need people with **skills** to
**handle and analyse** this data.

Ex. Former Hertie Master's students co-founded
[CorrelAid](http://correlaid.org/) to assist NGOs with data analysis.

# 🏭 Industry 

Automated data collection and retrieval **scales**.

We don't just want to solve a customer problem once, we want to solve it many times with the **marginal cost decreasing** each additional time we solve the problem.

```{r return-to-scale, echo=FALSE, fig.height = 2.5, dpi=300}
x <- seq(1, 10, 0.01)
returns_to_scale <- tibble(x = x, y = x^-2)

ggplot(returns_to_scale, aes(x, y)) +
  geom_line(color = "pink", size = 1) +
  xlab("Quantity produced") + ylab("Cost of production\n") +
  theme(
        axis.text.x=element_blank(),
        axis.ticks.x=element_blank(),
        axis.text.y=element_blank(),
        axis.ticks.y=element_blank()
        )
```

# 🏭 Industry 

So, data science being able to automate data retrieval and management are highly valued. E.g. on [PayScale](https://www.payscale.com/research/DE/Job=Data_Scientist/Salary):

```{r pay-by-experience, echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("img/pay-by-experience.png")
```

# ⍰ What is reproducible research?

---

class: inverse, centre, middle
background-color: #FFC400

#  Really reproducible research

> the data and code used to make a finding are **available** and they are **sufficient** for an independent researcher to **recreate the finding** (Peng 2011, 1226)

Make available the research, **not just the advertising** for the findings (e.g. papers, book).

---

# Reproducibility vs. Replication

**Reproducibility**: an independent study makes the same findings using the
**same data** and **code** as the original researchers.

**Replicability**: an independent study makes the same conclusions as the original
using **other** data, code, and even methods,
i.e. independent verification.

---

# Reproducibility vs. Replication

> ''A study can be reproducible and still be wrong'' [Peng 2014](http://simplystatistics.org/2014/06/06/the-real-reason-reproducible-research-is-important/).

E.g. a finding that is statistically significant in one study may remain statistically
significant when reproduced using the original data/code, but **replication studies
are unable to find a similar result**.

The original finding could just have been
[noise](http://andrewgelman.com/2014/09/03/disagree-alan-turing-daniel-kahneman-regarding-strength-statistical-evidence/).

---

# Why reproducibility?

- **Replication** is the ''**ultimate standard**'' for judging scientific claims (Peng 2011).

- **Reproducibility**

    + **Enhances replication** (other researchers can understand how an analysis
    was actually done)

    + Is a **minimum standard** for judging scientific claims when replication is
    not possible.

---

# Why reproducibility?

Reproducibility helps **avoid effort duplication**:

- Others **don't waste time**:

    + Gathering data that has already been gathered.

    + Discovering procedures that have already been discovered.

---

# Why reproducibility?

- Reproducibility also makes it possible to **find and correct errors**.

- Recent examples:
    - Translation errors in the
    [World Values Survey](http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/monkey-cage/wp/2014/09/02/world-values-lost-in-translation/).

    - Data errors in research on
    [intestinal worm treatment and school attendance](http://www.columbia.edu/~mh2245/w/worms.html).

    - [L'Affaire LaCour](http://www.vox.com/2015/5/20/8630535/same-sex-marriage-study):
    data *fabrication* discovered.

- Data errors can cause spurious findings that ultimately **waste researchers time**,
because they try to explain 'wrong' findings.

---

# Why reproducibility?

- **Higher research impact**

    + Reproducible research is likely to be more **useful for other researchers**.
    They can use your data and learn from your code and methods.

    + More use → more impact (e.g. citations)

- **Better work habits**

    + Thinking about reproducibility from the beginning makes your files
    **better organised** and your work is **better documented**.

    + This allows you to **build on your own work** more effectively.

# Practical tips for reproducible research

- ✏️ Document Everything!

- 📄 Everything is a (text) file.

- 🤓 All files should be human readable.

- ⋈ Explicitly tie your files together.

- 🗂 Have a plan to organise, store, and make your files available.
