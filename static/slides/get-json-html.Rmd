# Caveat about Web Scraping

- We are only scratching the surface of web scraping

- I just want you to know that these things are possible, so that you know where to look in future work.

# üë©‚Äçüíª Web scraping

[Web scraping](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_scraping) simply means gathering data from websites.

Last lesson we learned a particular form of web scraping: downloading tabular and often tidy structured data files/data APIs.

You can also download information that is not as well structured for statistical analysis:

- HTML tables

- Text on websites

- Information that requires you to navigate through web forms

To really master web scraping you need a good knowledge of HTTP and HTML.

---

# The most basic tools for web scraping in R:

- [rvest](https://github.com/hadley/rvest): scraping + parsing

    + [Parsing](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parsing): the analysis of HTML
    (and other) markup so that each element is syntactically related in a
    **parse tree**.

- [httr](https://github.com/r-lib/httr): gather data from APIs + simple parsing

- [jsonlite](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/jsonlite/index.html): parse and create JSON

- Also, [XML](http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/XML/index.html)
parsing

# Key steps:

1. **Look at** the HTML for the webpage you want to scrape (e.g. use Inspect 
Element in Chrome).

2. **Request** a URL with `read_html` (rvest) or `GET` (httr).

3. **Extract** the specific content nodes from the request with `html_nodes`.

4. **Convert** the nodes to your desired R object type.

5. **Clean** content (there are many tools for this suited to a variety of
problems).

# üë©‚ÄçHTTP: Hypertext Transfer Protocol

Tim Berners-Lee proposed and implemented the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP).

Allowed documents to be **linked** to each other. 

Today HTTP defines **request** and **response** *methods*.

```{dot http, echo=FALSE, fig.retina=10, cache=TRUE, fig.width=4}
digraph http {
    graph [layout = dot, rankdir = LR, overlap = true];
    edge [arrowsize = 0.5];
    node [shape = rectangle];

    d1   [label = "Your Computer (client)"];
    d2   [label = "Server (host)"];

    d1 -> d2[label="Request"];
    d2 -> d1[label="Response"]
}
```

---

# ‚ÄçHTTP Verbs

HTTP **request** and **response** methods are often called "[HTTP verbs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Methods)". The verbs include:

| HTTP Verb | Action                               |
| :-------- | ------------------------------------ |
| `GET`     | Requests data from source            |
| `HEAD`    | GETs only the head of the resource   |
| `POST`    | Submit an entity to the server       |
| `CONNECT` | Establishes a "tunnel" to the server |

---

# Uniform Resource Locators (URL)

Resources are located with URLs. 

You can think of these as (largely) file paths to the resource. For example:

```R
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/URL
```

- `https` - designates that it is an HTTPS (hypertext transfer protocol secure)

- `en.wikipedia.org` - English wikipedia

- `wiki` - it's a wiki page

- `URL` - the specific resource

---

# [The full schema](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/URL#Syntax)!

```{r full-schema, echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("img/URI_syntax_diagram.svg")
```

---

# R as your HTTP client

Get the head of the URL Wikipedia page

```{r, cache=TRUE}
library(httr)

url <- "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/URL"

head_wiki_url <- HEAD(url)

names(head_wiki_url)

head_wiki_url
```

---

# Note: HTTP is "stateless"

Every HTTP request and response happens as-if no request or response has ever been made before.

---

# HTTP Status Codes

After making an HTTP request, check the status code.

```yaml
Response [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/URL]
  Date: 2020-05-30 11:57
  Status: 200
  Content-Type: text/html; charset=UTF-8
<EMPTY BODY>
```

[HTTP status codes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_HTTP_status_codes) tell you the status of the HTTP request/response. Some include:

| Code | Means        |
| :--- | ------------ |
| 200  | OK           |
| 400  | Bad request  |
| 401  | Unauthorized |
| 404  | Not found    |

# Introduction to HTML

HTML: Hypertext Markup Language

Markup language: machine readable annotations of a text. Annotations give instructions to a compiler to format the document.

# Simple HTMl document

```html
<head>
    <base>http://fake.base.url</base>
</head>

<body>
    <h1>A title</h1>

    <p>This is a paragraph.</p>
</body>

<footer>
    Christopher Gandrud.
</footer>

```html
<head>

</head>

<body>
    <h1>A level 1 header</h1>

    <p>This is a paragraph.</p>
</body>

<footer>

`<head> </head>` is the head **tag**.
